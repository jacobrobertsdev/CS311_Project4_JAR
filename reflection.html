        With this project, learning the framework was the most challenging part for me. I have been working with vanilla
        CSS for about one year, and feel more comfortable using it than using a framework to layout a page. I wanted to
        focus more on layout than other stylistic choices (fonts, colors, etc.). I can see
        where a framework like Bootstrap or others could be very useful once you learn it/them in-depth, and could
        really speed things up when there isn't time for manually writing all of the CSS. I chose Bootsrap this time,
        but I'd like to explore Tailwind in the future, which I know is very popular as well. Otherwise, I did not run
        into
        signifigant problems with this particular project.
